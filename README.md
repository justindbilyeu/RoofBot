## ðŸ“Œ Concept Summary
This repository documents the concept for a **mini skid-steer attachment** designed specifically for **roofing applications**.  
The attachment would enable safer, faster, and more efficient material handling and demolition on residential and commercial roofs.  
By integrating a purpose-built tool for roofing, contractors can reduce labor strain, improve jobsite safety, and streamline cleanup.

## ðŸš§ Problem Statement
Roofing crews currently rely on manual tear-off and debris handling methods that are:
- Labor-intensive  
- Time-consuming  
- Hazardous (risk of falls, repetitive strain, and heat exhaustion)  

While mini skid-steers are used on jobsites, there is no dedicated, optimized attachment engineered for **roof tear-off and material transport**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution
Design and prototype a **roofing-specific mini skid-steer attachment** with the following features:
- **Demolition edge or claw** for shingle/panel removal.  
- **Integrated debris collection** system to reduce scatter.  
- **Angled dump capability** for easy transfer into trailers or dumpsters.  
- **Lightweight but durable frame** to avoid damaging surfaces.  

---

## ðŸ›  Applications
- Residential roof tear-off (asphalt, metal, tile).  
- Commercial flat roof demolition and cleanup.  
- Material transport (bundles, panels, underlayment).
